# Phase 7 · Sprint 2.1 Testing Log

## Automated
- `go test ./...` — unit & integration coverage for IC engine and consolidate refresh job.
- `go vet ./...` — static analysis for regressions.
- `go test -run TestConsolidateRefreshJob ./internal/e2e` — observability validation for job metrics.

## Manual / Observability
- Invoked `ConsolOpsCLI.TriggerRefresh` against staging Redis to enqueue a manual consolidate refresh task.
- Observed Prometheus `/metrics` output includes `odyssey_jobs_total{job="consol:refresh"}` after job execution.
- Verified audit log payload contains `actor=system/job` for elimination headers within QA database snapshot.
